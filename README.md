# Quick HTML Formatting tool

This tool was design to speed up my work formatting HTML inputs while having a visual preview of what the text will look like.

## How does it work

**To add any HTML Tags:** Simply select the text and click any of the tags; they'll appear at the start and end. To insert a breakline click where needed; a line break will appear there. To add a link, paste the URL, click "a" tag; link wraps the selected text.

**Handling Multiple Lines:** Selecting lines and click the break tag adds a break between them, pressing "li" converts each sentence into a list item.

**Text capitalization:** Adjusts the capitalization of the selected text.

**Font Preview:** Allows us to change the font family of titles, text and links to preview how they will appear.
